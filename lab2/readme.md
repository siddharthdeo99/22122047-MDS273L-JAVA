Q.Lab Exercise Question
You are supposed to create a menu-driven program that has the following menu options:
1. Enter a name
2. Search for a name
3. Remove a name
Note:
The menu-driven program has to be made with the help of a do-while loop and switch-case statements.
Constraints:
The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
Format your results properly!!

ANS:- 
    This is the menu example.
        From where we can provide the options to the users.
            System.out.println("########### MENU ###########");
            System.out.println("## 1. Enter the name:    ###");
            System.out.println("## 2. Search for a name: ###");
            System.out.println("## 3. Remove a name:    ####");
            System.out.println("## 4. Print the name list ##");
            System.out.println("## 5. Quit              ####");
            System.out.println("############################");
